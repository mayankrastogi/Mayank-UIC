##Features:

- 3 Multi-targets for cereal boxes, each with their own scenes
- 1 Cylindrical target for milk
- 2 Image targets &ndash; one acts like a placemat, and the other like a magazine
- Each scene makes use of its own lighting, as appropriate for the scene
- Placing objects on the placemat hides their scenes and displays nutritional information
- When not placed on the placemat, bringing any of the cereal boxes or the can closer, each exhibits a different reaction
- 3D magazine whose pages can be turned with a flip animation by using the virtual buttons
