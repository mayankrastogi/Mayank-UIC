## How to use

For the best experience, you will need to have a virtual reality headset, such as HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. This project has been tested on HTC Vive. If you don't have access to a VR headset, you may use the built-in Simulator; instructions to use the simulator will be provided on the screen.

1. Download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/mayankrastogi/EveryDayIsHalloween)
2. Open the project using Unity
3. Open `Scenes` =&gt; `MainScene`. Make sure no other scene is loaded

Alternatively, you may download a pre-built executable file from the GitHub releases page. However, please note that **the lighting will not work realistically**, so it's highly recommended that you run it from inside Unity.

4. Go to the center of your playing area, otherwise you might spawn inside a wall, and everything will be black (with your controllers vibrating)
5. Run the project (if using Unity), or the downloaded executable
6. If the player spawns slightly above the ground, use the `Menu` button to fix it

## Player Controls (for HTC Vive)

1. **Grab Objects:** Press `Trigger` button to grab an object and hold it to keep grabbing. There is no need to hold the trigger to keep on grabbing the **Flashlight**.
2. **Toggle Flashlight:** Press the `Touchpad` button to toggle the flashlight switch while grabbing a flashlight
3. **Recenter Play Area:** Press the `Menu` button to recenter the world in your physical play area. Handy if the player spawns above the normal height, or if the world gets pushed for some reason 

## Project Description

We decided to make a scary house for our project. The house consists of 4 main rooms, 2 rooms to navigate between the 4 main rooms, and an outdoors environment.

- Four Main Rooms
  1.	Living Room
  2.	Cellar Room
  3.	Kitchen Room
  4.	Bedroom Room
- Two Navigation Rooms
  1.	Corridor Room
  2.	Stairway Room
- Environment
  1.	Environment outside the house

## Directions through the House

### Living Room --> Corridor
When the game starts the player is spawned in the living room. The living room has only one door which leads into the corridor. The player must perform a task in the living room to open the door to the next room. When the living room door is opened the player can move through the opened door into the corridor which leads to the cellar room and the kitchen.

### Corridor --> Cellar 

The corridor has three doors, one to enter the living room, another to enter the cellar room and the third to enter the kitchen. On entering the corridor, the living room door shuts and the door to the cellar room opens. The player can then only enter the cellar room. On entering the cellar room, the cellar door shuts and traps the player into the cellar.

### Cellar --> Corridor

The cellar room only has one door to enter and exit. The exit leads to the corridor. 
As the cellar door is closed shut, the player must perform a task to open the cellar door to enter back into the corridor. On performing the cellar door opens leading back into the corridor.

### Corridor --> Kitchen

On entering back into the corridor, the cellar door shuts so the player cannot enter back into the cellar and the kitchen door opens. Since the living room door is already shut the player is forced to enter the kitchen.

### Kitchen --> Stairway

The kitchen has two doors. One leading from the corridor and the other leading into the stairway. On entering the kitchen from the corridor, the corridor door shuts. The door which leads into the stairway also shut. The player must perform a task to open the stairway door and enter the stairway.

### Stairway --> Bedroom

The stairway has two doors one on the 1st floor which leads into the kitchen, and a door on the second floor which leads into the kitchen. The stairway scene has a stairway which connects the ground and first floors. On entering the stairway room from the kitchen, the door to the kitchen closes and the door to the bedroom on the first floor opens. The player must walk up the stairs to enter the bedroom.

### Bedroom --> Finishing the Game

In the bedroom there is only one door which leads back to the staircase.
On entering the bedroom, bedroom door closes, and the player must complete a task to finish the game. 

## Detailed description of objects in the rooms

### Living Room

#### Task to Complete 
On starting the VR application, the player is spawned in the living room. The door in the living room is locked. To open the door to exit the living room, the player must search for the flashlight and turn on the flashlight. The flashlight is hidden in the top left cabinet of the cupboard in the living room. The player can grab the flashlight with any controller. Once the flashlight is in the players hand the player press the track pad to turn on and off the light.

We used more than 20 unique models for the living room and 5 custom objects.
