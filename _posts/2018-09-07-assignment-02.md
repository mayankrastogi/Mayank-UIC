This week we looked at how to use Unity and Vuforia to render any virtual object in an augmented reality scene. Vuforia makes it very easy to have a simple AR scene ready in a few clicks! For instance, to render an astronaut in the above picture, this is all I did:

 1. Add Vuforia support to your Unity project
 2. Add an `AR Camera` to your scene
 3. Add an `image target` which will be used as reference for placing the virtual astronaut
 4. Add the astronaut object inside the `image target` object
 5. `Play` the scene, point the webcam towards the printed image of my `image target` and voila! &mdash; the astronaut appears on top of the printed image target!

Sure, my astronaut does nothing but stare in one direction! But imagine how powerful this technology can be!
