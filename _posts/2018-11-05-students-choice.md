The [Teslasuit](https://teslasuit.io/) is a full-body VR haptic suit. It is *"the worldâ€™s first fully integrated smart clothing apparel with Haptic Feedback, Motion Capture, Climate Control and Biometric Feedback systems."*

The suit is not yet released for commercial use, but is available for B2B customers (enterprises and game development studios). The Teslasuit platform comes with SDKs for [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com) and [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com) game engines for developing fully-immersive XR experiences.

The Teslasuit has been used and reviewed by people at [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/news/beyond-haptics-blurring-the-line-between-your-virtual-avatar-and-your-body) and [Seeker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9PjcgqKAfw), and they have great things to say about it!
